				<h1>About</h1>
				<h2>What is Badhacks?</h2>
				<p>We're having a party, and you're all invited!</p>
				<p>BadHacks is IEEE NU's annual (since last year lmao) mini-hackathon where you are not only allowed, but encouraged to bring your worst tech ideas to life. This year, we upped our marketing budget just enough to have a theme - parties!
				<p>Destroy moods on the dance floor with a hack that skips a song when too many people start cheering or singing along! Challenge your taste buds with an app that purposely gives you shitty mixed drink recipes! Create something that has nothing to do with partying! Whatever your counter-productive idea is, make it come to life at BadHacks.</p>

				<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
				<h2>Why the disco ball?</h2>
				<p>We're having a party.</p>

				<h2>I've never coded on anything except homework assignments. Will I be out of place if I try to compete here?</h2>
				<p>Nope! If anything, this will be a good thing. Everyone has to start somewhere, and what better place to start than at a party?! We'll have mentors on hand to help you with any questions, as well as plenty of games and distractions to let you cool down if you feel frustrated.</p>
				<p>And if your project turns out not looking as hot as you had hoped, no worries! After all, the name of this hackathon is BadHacks, so...</p>

				<h2>I can't code for more than an hour at a time. What fun activities can I distract myself with if I get frustrated?</h2>
				<p>We'll have competitions throughout the day (check out the schedule), as well as some games lying around that you can just jump in and play at any time. The games include Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Mario Kart Wii, and, like all good parties, some good old Nugget Pong!</p>
				<p>We also have a special surprise for you, developed by our own team of top tier CS students, call BadApp. You'll have to show up to find out what it is!</p>

				<h2>What are the prizes?</h2>
				<p>Prizes include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Participation: party hats, stickers, bubbles, noisemakers</li>
					<li>Category Winners: Vuvuzelas</li>
					<li>BadApp Winner: A bag of candy!</li>
					<li>"Most Ian Award": an autographed picture of Ian Horswill</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Is there travel reimbursement?</h2>
				<p>Nope! We spent our reimbursement money on chicken nuggets from Burger King.</p>

				<h2>I have another question that isn't listed on this extremely helpful FAQ.</h2>
