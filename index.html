			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<h2>Why the disco ball?</h2>
			<p>If you haven't guessed, this year's theme is parties! We know how stressful life can be as a programmer, so we wanted everyone to unwind and relax with us for this one night. </p>
			<h2>I've never coded on anything except homework assignments. Will I be out of place if I try to compete here?</h2>
			<p>Nope! If anything, this will be a good thing. Everyone has to start somewhere, and what better place to start than at a party?! We'll have mentors on hand to help you with any questions, as well as plenty of games and distractions to let you cool down if you feel frustrated (and trust us, you will feel frutrated at some point). And if your project turns out not looking as hot as you had hoped, no worries! After all, the name of this hackathon is BADhacks! </p>
